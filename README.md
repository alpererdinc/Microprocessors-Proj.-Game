# La Cassembly de Papel: A Password Game

LCDP is a game in which you will try to find the correct password of the Money Safe in 3 difficulties.

## Problem Definition

We wanted to make a safe password cracking game. For this, we needed a menu that directs the user, a system that receives a number from the user and recognizes whether this number matches a random password that only the program knows. At the same time, we wanted to give separate input rights for each digit in the password. And the user should have 5 tries for each entry. We had to strive to make the game have a friendly language and an easy interface. The game required 3 difficulty levels and separate code blocks for each.

## The Procedure

We thought a lot and exchanged ideas to find the game idea. We finally found the type of game that suits us best. We discussed the problems at hand among ourselves, and tried and failed many times in our search for solutions. We solved those 5 tries by creating a counter using LEDs. In this way, we wrote a game code that uses both the output screen and the LED display screen of the assembly language and Emu8086.
